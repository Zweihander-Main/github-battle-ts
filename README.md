# Github-Battle-TS

> TypeScript implementation of GitHub battle app (using Hooks) originally by [tylermcginnis](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/). [Live demo](https://github-battle.zweisolutions.com)

### Tech stack:

-   TypeScript
-   React + Hooks
-   React-router

-   React Testing Library
-   Webpack

### Additions to original:

### Live demo:

[Available at github-battle.zweisolutions.com](https://github-battle.zweisolutions.com)

### Instructions

1. Run `npm install` in the main directory (package.json should be accurate)
    - Special Notes:
    - Source/Dev: app folder, Production: dist folder
2. Run one of the commands from the [Scripts](#scripts) section. You'll most likely want `npm run dev` for development and `npm run build` for production.

### Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Create development build and serve it on dev server
-   `npm run build`: Build application for production (build directory: dist)
-   `npm run build-win`: Build application for production in Windows
-   `npm run test`: Run tests
-   `npm run testWatch`: Run tests in watch mode

### Current TODOs:

-   None as of now
